Handmade Raylib 5.5 bindings for the Fennel programming language (and consequently for Lua) for the sake of interest.

API coverage is 99% (or maybe even 100%)

Includes:
- Built-in Raylib dynamic libraries for x64 Windows and Linux.
- Makefile for Windows and Linux
- Lume library


The only thing you need to have installed is Luajit and (optionally) Fennel. The main bindings file is `raylib.fnl` or its compiled version `raylib.lua`.


To start working just git clone this repo and try to `make run` or `fennel examples/core/core-input-keys.fnl`
